# robeatsdiscordpresence
Discord Rich Presence for the Roblox game, RoBeats, using keyboard shortcuts, screen capture, and an OCR.

# Usage

This program requires tesseract to be installed. Install it here:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract

After installing tesseract, you must launch RoBeats, and get the coordinates of the song name area. I recommend taking the size of the song name in the songs tab on the bottom left. Enter the values into index.js, and run it!

Press Control+K to take the song name and set it as your status.
